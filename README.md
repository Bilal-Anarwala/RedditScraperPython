# RedditScraperPython

This project was an opportunity for me to explore two areas I’ve always wanted to dive into—automating tasks with Python and working with APIs.

The inspiration came from my interest in browsing Reddit. Using Python and the Reddit API (PRAW), I built a script that allows users to scrape data from any subreddit of their choice. The program prompts users to select the type of posts to retrieve (Hot, New, Top, Rising) and how many posts they’d like to scrape. Afterward, the script asks for a name for the output file and saves the scraped data—post titles and upvote counts—in an Excel file using the Openpyxl library.

Note: Due to Reddit's recent API changes, which require paid access, this program no longer functions unless you have an API subscription.
